    text: 'Why choose HSN Advisory?',
    answer:
      'I offer the same strategic insights and tailored advice you’d get from a big consulting firm—but without the hefty price tag. Plus, you get a personal, hands-on approach that prioritises long-term relationships and ongoing support, not just one-size-fits-all solutions.',
  },
  {
    text: 'How do I know if my business is "big enough" to benefit from your services?',
    answer:
      'Every business, no matter its size, can benefit from expert advice. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to scale, my approach is tailored to fit your current stage and future growth. If you have challenges you want to overcome or ambitions you want to achieve, I can help.',
  },
  {
    text: 'Can your services be delivered remotely, and are they just as effective online?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely! All of my services can be delivered 100% online through video calls. I’ve designed my approach to ensure that the quality of advice and support remains just as effective whether we’re meeting in person or virtually. This way, you can access expert guidance from anywhere, without compromising results.',
  },
  {
    text: 'What happens after the initial consultation?',
    answer:
      'After our no-cost 30-minute call, we’ll schedule more time together to go deeper. From there, we’ll decide together how best to move forward, whether it’s through ongoing advisory, project-based work, or implementation support. There’s no obligation—just a roadmap to success.',
  },
  {
    text: 'What if I’m not sure what services I need?',
    answer:
      'That’s exactly why the initial consultation is so valuable. In our first 30-minute call, we’ll discuss your business and uncover where I can offer the most support, whether it’s strategy, finance, or technology.',
  },
